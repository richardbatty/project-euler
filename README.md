# Project Euler answers

These are my solutions to [project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) questions.

You can run each exercise with `rake acceptance[<exercise number>]` e.g.:

```sh
rake 'exercise[1]'
```
This runs the exercise and checks the answer against the answers from [projecteuler-solutions](https://code.google.com/p/projecteuler-solutions/wiki/ProjectEulerSolutions).

Run all exercises with:

```sh
rake all
```

You can run the unit tests with:

```sh
rake spec
```
